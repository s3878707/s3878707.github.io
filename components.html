          <h3>Team name</h3>
          <p>There is no name coming into my mind now. However, if I have to choose, it will be a simple name because everything is built from the smallest things.</p>
          <h3>Team profile</h3>
          <p>First of all, a captain is compulsory member when I choose a team. Because I am not the person who will follow the plan so I need someone can force us to keep up with deadline. Besides that, I want to have one that could deliver complex idea to everyone because assignment 3 is still about writing and there will be a presentation so that kind of person will be a huge advantage for team. And the last one is person who is good at Powerpoint because of the upcoming presentation for sure. Last but not least, responsible members are those everyone want to have in their team, and I am not an exception.  </p>

            <p></p>This is video is about an interview of an ‘Internet Police’. He will fight against hackers and virus or generally criminals online. He also said that there are some big misconceptions in this job which are: people working in IT are usually seen as a geek although there are different types of people and there are some are really good at conveying their ideas to the crowd, not only ones who just sit in a corner and do not interact with the outside world. Moreover, he also is asked that why he does not become a cybercriminal although it could make more money. Then, the desire of defending internet and battling with cybercriminal is what draw him into this industry and he also does not want to be in jail. After all, through this video, I realize that IT is not just a job that you have to look at the screen all day and not interact with the world and he also show me the passion of becoming security online although people may ignore this background job.

           <p> This video shows us the daily life of an IT professional when facing the vendor. He shows us one of his frustrating things that every IT professional might deal with. It means that maybe our jobs and our environments have some different from other jobs. However, they might not really care about this little difference, they just put their rules and policies and force us follow and we do not deviate from those.</p>

            <p>This news show that most of IT professional spend most of their time at work or specifically on screen. Due to the heavy workload of this jobs, an IT professional has to spend about 60 hours per week compared to 34 hours for a national general employee, which make them stay away from computer anytime they could. They want to have more time for their hobbies, interests or doing something else not about IT.</p>

             <p> This is a video from a guy working for Twitter. His daily life is just like other guys: waking up, having breakfast, going to work, … And most of his time is doing on his laptop and rarely interact with other people. However, he seems not like a geek like people usually think about an IT professional</p>

             <p> Making mistake is parts of the learning process’ is what the author said about this job. Every day is a new day, you will have some different issues that you haven’t met before and you have to update your knowledge continuously. There always will be a new programming language and an IT profession has to improve skills and techniques more and more. </p>
