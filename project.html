          <h2><strong>	Artificial intelligence and machine learning</strong></h2>
          <h3>What does it do?</h3>
          <p>Obviously, nowadays there are more and more games using AI and machine learning in their games into every motions of characters. Like in Fifa, the way footballers were used AI because it could update the motions continuously in every condition like shooting, dribbling or where they will go to too but if without AI, the motions of players would be very strange and hard to build, consuming a lot of time. Also, in role-playing game, thanks to AI and machine learning, not only the way NPC or characters moving is getting more naturally but also the way characters, NPC, background or even entire engine could react according to every situation that the players might make. For example, a boss or a monster in game could react and know how to fight against the way players moving or using trick. In this project, if we use AI technology, like other role-playing game, it could build a character which can react, or act like a normal person in different situation. In other words, the NPC could have an intelligence as a normal person, the difficulty levels of the mission or the boss could be upgraded dependent on the player and the rewards could be automatically given to players if they reach the goal. In this project, AI definitely plays a crucial part of the game, it could build distinct movement patterns, the intelligence for NPC as well as monsters, and the system progressing interaction between players and NPC in game. Until now, AI is almost complete in order to build a role-playing game, but the most drawback about it is about the cost. It is too expensive for small firms to build a game with machine learning and there are some minor errors which AI often get. However, I hope that in the future it might be available for small firms and becomes more complete.</p>
          <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
          <p>The development of this technology could affect human life greatly. In the future, AI could replace all that jobs that seems time-consuming. Maybe in the future, there will be a game partner using AI who can share a day, confine with us or even encourage us to get through difficulties. In daily life, there is a robot using AI to do chores or some stuffs. In the future, there may be a robot which could build a house, do some manual works and because of the efficiency of robot, there will be redundant of the unemployed who is nothing compared to robot. However, AI should be under control or else it will self-develop and becomes out of control of human.</p>
          <h3>How will this affect you? </h3>
          <p>Maybe in the future, it will affect me and my family a lot. We will have more time to do what we want and more time to follow our dream, our hobbies. My parents can save more time to relax and improve their health by doing exercise. About the world, goods could be produced more and more quality and efficiency is undeniable when using AI.

          <h2>	Cybersecurity and privacy</h2>
          <div class="section-container-spacer">
            <h3>What does it do?</h3>
            <p>Nowadays, privacy information of users always is priority. Therefore, cybersecurity is getting more and more important for all social media as well as online game. It is used to protect users’ information and prevent from being stolen. Moreover, it is also seen as a tool to save users’ data and help user get back their account in case someone steals it. However, there are always gaps in this technology, the sign is that there are always victims who are stolen account which is sold on black market with an enormous price. Nevertheless, it is still the most useful technology until now which I definitely use in my project. Because this is a VR game so privacy is the most important problem that we have to concern. With VR, we can scan our faces as a key allow us to enter the game, however if cybersecurity is not good, not only the face scan but the data can be lost and put a detrimental impact on our game. Therefore, in the future, cybersecurity must be improved and to do that, AI could be a solution when it can recognize what is real or fake as a normal person with real eyes. Moreover, awareness of hacker should be raised and they have to know that invading privacy, stealing information and selling it is guilty. </p>
            <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
            <p>With development of this technology, people do not have to afraid of losing their privacy when using social media as well as playing online game, especially VR one. Due to that development, people tend to store their secret recipes or information on online platform that only them can access if cybersecurity is modern enough. Because of that, some bank may bankrupt when money could be trade by an app or something else, which is much safer than holding it outside with high rate of being burgled. As a result, who doing in bank might become unemployed.</p>
            <h3>How will this affect you? </h3>
            <p>In daily life, it may not change so much when I get used to pay online today, but it may a challenge for my family, especially the elderly because they are used to use cash, learning to pay by different way may hard for them. Moreover, I might store information on the online platform if it gets better and better because it is very convenient and high protective.</p>
