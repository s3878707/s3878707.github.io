            <h2>Project Ideas</h2>
            <p> <strong>Overview:</strong>
                The project is about an online role-playing game. There will be a fantasy world with a lot of different races such as fairy, orc, dragon, … and players could choose any roles that they want which will have different stories and quests. They can connect with other players to build their own tribes or villages. There will be some similar traits in this game to the real life except the background is more romantic and fictional.
                
            <br><strong>Motivation</strong>	
            The reason why I choose this kind of game because I want to make a world that people could enjoy and do whatever they want, see things that the real world do not have. Like other boys, dragon, fairy, knight combined with game so why not? I was inspired by many games like this: Blade and Soul, Dark Soul, Genshin Impact or some Vietnamese game like Vo Lam Chi Mong or Tieu Ngao Giang Ho and Sword Art Online is the most inspiring film that give me a lot of emotions to make this game. Of course that my game definitely will not look like anime so don’t worry about that. You may ask that is it a risk for me to make a game that there are many games like this on the market and some of them has some reputations? Yes, maybe. However, it is not only about money but it is also what I am passionate about.

                                Unity probably the most useful tools that I have to buy and master of it. Besides that, I have to find someone who have the same passion to implement my ideas to them and get feedback. Maybe find someone who usually play many kind of games to hear my ideas in order to have their feedbacks is also a good way to complete this game.

                            First of all, any game development require proficiency in programming language: Python, the game also need a story so character, graphic, story and sound design are those positions that I definitely need in the future or maybe I will learn one of those in the future too. VR and AR technology also are things that I have to understand more.

          <p>From the beginning, you will be asked to choose what races you want to become and what type of weapons you like such as axe, sword or mage… After that you just need follow the story and the instructions of NPC. There will be some hint items and special way or secret mission to get it on the way you complete the story. There will be many worlds to explore, the more mission you complete, the more worlds will open for you. And when you get certain levels, there will be some uncapping functions like trading items with other players, teamwork quest, building a trait or a function that usually is missing in other games: building a house which I find interesting. You can use your money that you earned after completing quest or defeating boss to buy a land in any world you want (the higher level world and more powerful monster surrounding, the more expensive the land cost). After that, you can decorate and design your house where you can store your valuable items and have HP restore as well as raise some pets and plants some trees which could be an items, and obviously, show off how rich you are. I will think more about this function in future to make it more useful. And if you are boring to live alone in that immense space, you can have someone live with you and it is call marriage function which will be available at a certain level. Moreover, there will be some bosses that you must to defeat in order to get specific items. If you watched Sword Art Online, there are some bosses requiring you to have a team with all type of characters for the condition. Specifically, NPC could be killed in my game too and the player could get their items and players also can kill each other to steal their items in the zone that allow them to do that. In some games, there will be a final boss and the game will end after defeating that boss. However, my game is not like that. It is more online game than story game. Items and bosses will be updated continuously and the map will be expanded more and more. Sometimes I will have an appointment among tribes in order to hear their opinion and how to develop game in the right way cause the game is successful or not based on player’s experience. There are some games fall because they do not listen to their players. Last but not least, there always will have events for players to get items as well as upgrade their strength.</p>

          <h2>feedbacks</h2>
          <p>According to the feedback, the most important part of my project is VR and AR. However, as I do some research, this technology is not available in Vietnam because of the cost being too high. In the future, I hope that this one could be widespread over the world. Of course that my project definitely has a lot of challenges at the beginning but I will do all my best to make this game alive. Moreover, after reading through your feedback, I feel like your dream come true, every boys always have the dream that they could enter a fantasy world and play as a knight defeating monster. And I agree with Huy’s feedback that I need more details for characters as well as and give them a story. Understanding more clearly about VR and AR is necessary if I seriously want to do this project and make it success. <br>About the second feedback, if one day the game is complete, you will be invited to become one of the first players to try my game in the future for sure. And these are useful feedbacks that help me a lot and give me motivation to follow my dream and reach the goal.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Outcome</h2>
            <p class="text-center">If this game becomes successful, there will be a virtual world - a place where people can do whatever they want without rules or limitations, a place that their creation is limited. Especially for some people with unfortunate circumstances, they can do the things that they could not before and feel as a normal person. 
                </p>
            <p>The drawbacks of this project is that people are easily addicted to this VR game because people tend to run away from their real life and live in a world which does not have any difficulties, pains, or distance between rich and poor. Maybe the solution to this problem is that I will put a time limit for all players and when reaching the limitation, players will be asked to shut down or they will face some challenges. </p>
